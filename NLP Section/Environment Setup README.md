# 🧠 NLP Environment Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up a dedicated Python virtual environment for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects with all essential libraries installed.

## 🪜 Step 1: Create the Virtual Environment

A virtual environment allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without affecting the global Python installation.

`python -m venv nlp_course_env python=3.11`

- `python -m venv`: Creates a new virtual environment.  
- `nlp_course_env`: Name of your environment (you can choose another name if desired).  
- `python=3.11`: Specifies the Python version (ensure Python 3.11 is installed).

## ⚙️ Step 2: Activate the Environment

Activate the environment so all packages install inside it.
